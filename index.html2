            <p>
                Hi y’all! My name is Qamryn, and I am a senior studying Information Science
                with a certificate in Leadership. Outside of academics, I am a member of
                the Wisconsin Cheerleading team, which takes up much of my time during the
                school year. I am also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., and I
                currently serve as the President of the National Pan-Hellenic Council on campus.
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose to take this class because I am aware of the ongoing lack of
                representation—and frequent misrepresentation—of diverse human groups
                within computer science and technology fields. I wanted to better understand
                why these issues are becoming increasingly important today, how we can work
                to address them beyond simply increasing diversity numbers, and how to
                critically confront my own assumptions about technology and innovation.
            </p>

            <p>
                My favorite “tech” topic right now is learning about Big Data and artificial
                intelligence, particularly their ethical implications, environmental impact,
                integration into daily life and non-technology industries, and the ways they
                are reshaping human thinking and behavior.
